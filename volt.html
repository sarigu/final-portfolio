          </div>
          <p>
            For this project we collaborated with an external client. Volt is a
            young company that wants to optimise cultural experiences. They
            provide festival goers with power banks at Roskilde Festival. Almost
            15.000 sign up for their service online through the Volt website.
            Our given task was to improve their Roskilde landing page and the
            following purchase flow. (How can Volt better explain its services
            to new customers, simplify the customer journey from the landing
            page and reduce the bouncing rate?)

            We were a group of two and did the design sprint to develop a
            solution for the problem. You can have a look at our full
            documentation

            <span>Day 1 - Map:</span> <br />
            We mapped out the problem by analysing Voltâ€™s current solution and
            their Google Analytics data. We created a user journey and long term
            goals. We also defined the target group and created a persona based
            on our target group definition. We made an Eco model to use the
            insights for the following steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Day 2 - Sketch:</span> <br />
            We sketched ideas and tried to use our insights to adapt and improve
            the UX while doing so.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Day 3 - Decide:</span> <br />
            We decided upon a final sketch. We then created a moodboard and a
            storyboard for the video we wanted to include to draw the target
            group's attention to the product.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Day 4 - Prototype:</span> <br />
            We created a

            for the landing page and a coded version for the purchase flow. At
            this point we also made the icons and picked images we want to use.
            These are the icons inspired by the Roskilde Festival logo:

          <p>
            <span> Day 5 - Test:</span> <br />
            On day 5 we tested our solution. We did the BERT test to see if the
            webpage translates the feeling we intended to create. We had 11
            participants and the result were positive overall. For the purchase
            flow we did a Think Aloud test to see, if the users think there are
            any misconceptions or why certain parts are easy to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Day 6 - Code:</span> <br />
            We splitted up for coding. We coded section by section with the
            prototype in mind.

            and logos provided by Volt. We used Adobe XD for the prototype. The
            icons were made in Illustrator. The video mockup was made in After
            Effects. We used HTML, CSS and Javascript to create the landing page
            and purchase flow, you can find the

            My group partner worked on the business parts of the project (for
            instance the ECO model and Google Analytics data). She explained all
            her results to me and I was able to learn a lot from her. It was
            also great to apply all the things we learned in different areas in
            one project and see how far we can come within only a few days.
