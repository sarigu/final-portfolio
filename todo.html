          <p>
            Todo was an old group project we did in my last studies (
            <a
              href="https://github.com/sarigu/WebanwendungsProjekt"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Here</a
            >
            is a link to the old project). I really liked the project and wanted
            to redo it to apply my new gained skills and practice using forms,
            templates and databases. TODO is a place where people who live
            together can share (in form of todo lists) what needs to be done
            around the house and tasks can be distributed. Every tenant can edit
            all the todo lists and write notes and receipts.

        <section id="todo-section2">
          <div class="todo-headingwrapper2">
            <h2>Process</h2>

            I planned on what features to use. Therefore I had a look at the old
            project. I was thinking about some new ideas as well. Afer
            considering all the ideas I sketched a layout. I decided to use
            Javascript, HTML, CSS and Rest DB and change it to a mobile version
            this time. I started to code all the features that I wasnâ€™t sure of
            how to code. So in case I couldn't make the features work, I could
            still make some changes. After doing so, I added additionalfeatures
            on top and coded the rest of it. <br />
            <br />
            For the design I wanted to use only very little color. These are the
            only two colors I used besides white.

            <div id="color1"></div>

        <section id="todo-section3">
          <div class="todo-headingwrapper2">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <div class="todo-underline2"></div>
          </div>
          <p>
            I used Javascript, HTML and CSS for this project as well as Rest DB.
            I created 7 collections to store the data in total. Here is a link
            to
            <a href="https://github.com/sarigu/TO-DO" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
            and here is a link to the
            <a
              href="http://guckimonster.de/kea3/to-do/todo.html"

        <section id="todo-section4">
          <div class="todo-headingwrapper2">
            <h2>Thoughts</h2>
            <div class="todo-underline2"></div>
          </div>
          <p>
            I have a better understanding of forms and Rest DB as a database
            (coding and styling wise) now. I also learned how to code some new
            features along the way, which is great.
