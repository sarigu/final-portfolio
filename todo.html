          <p>
            Todo was an old group project we did in my last studies (link to old
            project). I really liked the project and wanted to redo it to apply
            my new gained skills and practice using forms, templates and
            databases. TODO is a place where people who live together can share
            (in form of todo lists) what needs to be done around the house and
            tasks can be distributed. Every tenant can edit all the todo lists
            and write notes and receipts.

            <h2>Process</h2>

          </div>
          <p>
            I had a look at our old project first. I decided to leave out some
            of the features such as the login and add other ones for instance
            the drag and drop task distribution tool or the calculator in order
            to have more elements that i think are useful and where i can apply
            what i have learned. I also planned on using JS, HTML, Css and Rest
            DB and making it a mobile version this time. I started to code all
            the features that I wasn’t sure how to code to make sure they work
            or can be changed before I actually start coding all of it. I then
            added additional features on top. For the design i wanted to use
            only very little color and see what fits while coding, since i
            didn’t know how some elements would turn out in the beginning.

          <p>
            I have a better understanding of forms and rest db as a database
            (coding and styling wise) now. I also learned how to code some new
            features along the way, which is great
