            The week assignment was to develop a story and characters for an
            animation. The story had to include a protagonist, antagonist,
            helper and an obstacle. We were supposed to have a narrative curve
            and use the dramaturgical elements. We also had to create a small
            spritesheet animation.

          <p>
            I wanted to create something that introduces children to foods from
            different countries. The idea is that the user can choose from
            several lunchboxes to begin with. Each lunchbox represents the most
            common food that is eaten for lunch in schools in a certain country.
            The main character named Kogi gets put into one of the lunchboxes
            either by spoon/fork, chopsticks or hand (depending on how people
            eat in the country the food is from). In each lunchbox Kogi
            experiences another adventure. <br /><br />In this story Kogi finds
            himself in a japanese lunchbox. There is a little tomato that gets
            chased by scary monster and Kogi needs to help the tomato cross the
            river.

            As my given style was flatdesign, I made a style tile to get to know
            the characteristics of the style. I also worked on the story idea,
            message and genre. The next step was to create a storyboard and each
            character. I thought about how the characters would look like from
            different sides and how animation principles could be applied to
            their movements.

            I used HTML, CSS and Illustrator to create the spritesheet animation

            It was interesting to see what goes into developing a small
            animation and I realised how important it is to apply animation
            principles to your animation, in order to create smooth motions.
