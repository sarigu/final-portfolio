            The week assignment was to develop a story and characters for an
            animation. The story had to contain a protagonist, antagonist,
            helper and an obstacle. We were supposed to have a narrative curve
            and use the dramaturgical elements. We also had to create a small
            spritesheet animation.

          <p>
            I thought it would be nice to create something where children can
            get familiar with foods from different countries. The idea was that
            the user can choose from several lunchboxes. Each lunchbox
            represents the most common food that is eaten for lunch in schools.
            The main character named Kogi gets put into one of the lunchboxes
            either by spoon/fork, chopsticks or hand (depending on how people
            eat in the country the food is from). In each lunchbox Kogi
            experiences another adventure. In this story Kogi is in a japanese
            lunchbox. Kogi needs to help the little tomato to cross the river
            because the little tomato get chased by scary monsters.

            My given style was flatdesign. I made a style tile to get to know
            more about the characteristics of the design. I also worked on the
            story idea, message and genre. The next step was to create a
            storyboard and the characters. I thought about how the characters
            would look like from different sides and how animation principles
            could be applied to their movements.

            It was interesting to see what goes into developing a small
            animation and I learned the importance of animation principles for
            smooth motions.
