            We had to create a Student List for the student administration of
            Hogwarts. The assignment had many requirements to it. The webpage
            had to display a list of students from a JSON file. We had to
            include sorting, filtering and a status of the number of students in
            total, in each house and expelled. Furthermore additional details of
            each student should be displayed in a pop up window. The user must
            be able to appoint a student temporarily to the Inquisitiorial Squad
            or expel a student. In the end we had to hack the list and change
            all blood types in JS . We also had to add ourselves to the list and
            visual effects in case the user wants to expel ourself.

          <p>
            We started off by writing down all the features the webpage needs to
            have to get a better overview. After making the list I wrote
            pseudocode (which you can find here). The assignment was split into
            4 smaller assignments. So I began coding the first version, which
            had the basic features. I then added more features on top and
            changed some of the functions with every following assignment. The
            pop up window for the students details aside, I applied design in
            the very end.

            The project is coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Here is a link to
            the Github repository. Here is a link to the final solution:

          <p>
            This assignment was a fairly big one in terms of code for me. I
            learned to effectively break down a big task that seems complicated
            to solve into smaller, more manageable pieces. I understood how
            helpful pseudocode is as well.
