            <h2>Hogwarts Student List</h2>

            We had to create a Student List for the student administration of
            Hogwarts. The assignment had many requirements to it: The webpage
            has to display a list of students from a JSON file. We have to
            include sorting, filtering and a status of the number of students in
            total, in each house and expelled. Furthermore additional details of
            each student should be displayed in a pop up window. The user must
            be able to appoint a student temporarily to the Inquisitiorial Squad
            or expel a student. We have to hack the list and change all blood
            types in JS at the end. We also have to add ourselves to the list
            and visual effects in case the user wants to expel ourself.

            To begin with we wrote down all the features the webpage needs to
            have. After getting an overview I started off by writing pseudocode,
            making a callgraph and a wireframe. You can find the three of them

              >here</a
            >. <br /><br />The assignment was split into four smaller
            assignments. So I began coding the first version, which had all the
            basic features. I then added more features on top and changed some
            of the functions with every upcoming assignment. I applied CSS
            styling in the very end.

          <p>
            This assignment was a fairly big one in terms of code for me. I
            learned to effectively break down a big task that seems complicated
            to solve into smaller, more manageable pieces. I understood how
            helpful pseudocode can be to structure your work beforehand and get
            a better understanding of what needs to be done overall.
