            The purpose of this project was to learn how to use scrolling
            related properties. We had to build a single page website that
            utilises as many scrolling features (parallax effect, overflow etc.)
            as possible. The page should contain several visually different
            sections, a fixed element and media that reacts to scrolling.

            Since the content was up to us, I decided to make a webpage for
            young people who would like to discover Tokyo.

            We had scrolling related exercises in class. In addition I looked up
            webpages that use scrolling effects to get some more inspiration. In
            order to come up with the section content, I created a persona.
            Based on that I came up with a simple theme for each section. I then
            sketched out effects I would like to incorporate. I tested the
            effects I was planning on using one by one. In the end I put them
            together and applied the design.

            <br />I used HTML, CSS and JS to create the scrollersite you can

            It was interesting to see how scrolling effects/properties can be
            used throughout a webpage and I will definitely try to use them more
            in future projects.
