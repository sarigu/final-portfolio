          <p>
            The purpose of this project was to learn how to use scrolling
            related properties. We had to build a single page website that
            utilises as many scrolling features (parallax effect, overflow etc.)
            as possible. The page should contain several visually different
            sections, a fixed element and media that reacts to scrolling.

          <h2>Idea</h2>
          <p>
            The content was up to us to I decided to make a page for people who
            would like to discover Tokyo.

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <p>
            We did scrolling related exercises in class. I also looked up
            webpages that use scrolling effects to get inspiration. I tested the
            effects that I decided to use seperatly and put them all together in
            the end. In order to come up with the section content, I created a
            small persona.

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>
            All the images that are used are not mine. The traditional japanse
            lamps are from adobe stock. The other images are from an â€¦ instagram
            account (link). The images are cropped in Photoshop. I used HTML,
            CSS and JS.
          </p>

          <h2>In conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            It was interesting to see how scrolling effects/propertied can be
            used throughout a webpage and I will definitely try to use them more
            in future projects.
