          Hello, I am Sari.<br><br> I grew up in Hamburg, Germany, but I am based in Copenhagen at the moment.
           I study Multimedia Design at KEA and my elective is Frontend Design. 
         I got introduced to coding during a math lecture in my prior Biology studies. I fell in love with coding right away. 
          Soon after I decided to combine my joy for digital media and programming and learn more about both.
          <br><br>Please scroll (horizontally) through my CV.

                <p><span>Jobs </span> <br><br>
                  Customer Support at Jimdo, Food deliveries at Foodora,  Assistant Coach at Hamburg Knights, Work and Travel in New Zealand <br><br>
                  <span>What I have learned </span> <br><br>
                 Jimdo is a website building platform. For that reason I got an insight on technical things and how users experience the online tools. <br><br> At Foodora I saw how the algorithm for the drivers kept evolving, which was interesting. I got used to a fast paced environment as well.<br><br>
                  As an assitant coach I learned to response to the player's needs, plan ahead and to be organised. <br><br>During Work and Travel I learned to take responsibility for my actions. </p>

              <p><span>Studies </span> <br><br>Multimedia Design at KEA, 
              Media Systems (B.Sc) at HAW (3 semesters),
              Biology (B.Sc) at Universit√§t Oldenburg (2 semester) <br><br><span>What I have learned </span> <br><br>
            In Biology I got introduced to a programming language called "R". I gained a big interest in coding, so I switched majors. <br><br>During my Media Systems studies I learned many things in the areas of computer science, gaming and dramaturgy. However the studies focused less on creating media, which is why I decided to enroll in the AP programme in Multimedia Design. </p>

                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <p><span>Coding related skills</span> <br><br>
                I coded in Java, Processing and HTML, CSS and JavaScript before. <br>Due to some courses I got glimpse of other programming languages as well. <br><br>In my current elective we use GitHub on a regular basis either for indivual or team projects.
                <br><br><span>Design related skills</span> <br><br>
               I used almost all Adobe programmes at least a couple of times. Nevertheless I am not equally good at using all of them. I know Illustrator, XD and After Effects the best and Photoshop and InDesign the least.</p>
