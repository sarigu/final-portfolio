          Hello. My name is Sari.<br> I grew up in Hamburg, Germany. 
          Currently I am studying Multimedia Design at KEA in Copenhagen. My elective is Frontend Design. 
         I got introduced to coding during a math lecture in my prior Biology studies. I fell in love with coding right away. 
          Soon after I decided to combine my joy for digital media content and programming and learn more about it.
          <br><br>Please scroll (horizontally) through my CV.

                <p><span>Jobs </span> <br>
                  Customer Support at Jimdo, Food deliveries at Foodora,  Assistant Coach at Hamburg Knights, Work and Travel in New Zealand <br><br>
                  <span>What I learned </span> <br>
                  At Jimdo I learned a lot of technical things as well as how users experience the online tools. At Foodora I saw how the algorithm for the drivers kept evolving, which was interesting to see. I also got used to a fast paced environment.
                  As an assitant coach I learned to response to the player's needs, plan ahead and to be organised. During Work and Travel I learned to take responsibility for my actions. </p>

              <p><span>Studies </span> <br>Multimedia Design at KEA, 
              Media Systems (B.Sc) at HAW (3 semesters),
              Biology (B.Sc) at Universit√§t Oldenburg (2 semester) <br><br><span>What I learned </span> <br>
            In Biology I got introduced to a programming language called "R". I was interested in coding ever since. During my Media Systems studies I learned a lot in the areas of computer science, gaming and dramaturgy. However the studies focused less on creating media, which is why I decided to enroll the AP in Multimedia Design. </p>

                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <p><span>Coding related skills</span> <br>
                I coded in Java, Processing and HTML, CSS and JavaScript before. Due to some courses I got glimpse of Phyton, R or Shell as well. In my elective we use GitHub on a regular basis either for indivual or team projects.
                <br><br><span>Design related skills</span> <br>
               I used almost all Adobe programmes at least a couple of times. Nevertheless I am not equally good at using all of them. I know Illustrator, XD and After Effects the best and Photoshop and InDesign the least.</p>
